I’m interested in going into software engineering or embedded systems once I graduate. Right now, I am conducting research on how students interact with generative AI while coding. I analuze behavioral and physiological responses such as eye tracking and motion data to better understand how AI tools affect focus, stress and learning. Outside of school, music is a huge part of who I am. I’ve played several instruments over the years (piano, guitar, bass, violin, and drums), and currently volunteer as a guitarist at my church. Currently I am working on improving my guitar and piano skills, as well as learning music theory and how music is shaped. During summers, I love to teach programming and electronics to middle to high school students in a program called HoustonPREP. I’ve been working there for 4 consecutive summers and I enjoy teaching and seeing student’s creative projects.'; /* The text */
