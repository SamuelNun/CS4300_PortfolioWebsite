            <h1>Samuel's Top Game Picks</h1>
            <h4>By: Samuel Nunez</h4>
            <p> With so many games out there, choosing what to play next can feel overwhelming. The gaming world is huge, filled with creative stories and unforgettable moments to share with friends. Over the years, certain titles have stood out to me not just becuase they are fun, but because they offer something truly special.</p>
            <p>These five games represent experiences that I believe almost anyone can enjoy, regfardless of their playstyle. From peaceful farming to intense roguelike action, from massive world-building to deep turn-based strategy and award-winning storytelling, each one brings something unique to the table. If you're looking for your next game to dive into, here are my top five games recommendations and why they're worth your time.</p>

            <h2>Top Games</h2>

            <p class="game-title"><a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" class="game-title" target="_blank">1. Stardew Valley</a></p>

            <span class="game-desc">Stardew Valley will always have a special place in my heart. There's something special about how simple, cozy, and rewarding it feels. It has a slow progression, which allows you to play at your own pace without having to feel pressured. With so many things you could do: farming, mining, fishing, foraging, raising animals, and decorating, that there is no single correct way to play, you just pick what you enjoy and take the game at your own pace.</span>
            <span class="game-desc">This game is one I usually recommend to anyone who is starting to play games, or is looking for a new game to play. There is no learning curve, it's simple and very intuitive. It's easy to pick up, easy to enjoy, and ahrd to stop playing once you get into it.</span>

            <p class="game-title"><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft" class="game-title" target="_blank">2. Minecraft</a></p>
            <span class="game-desc">Minecraft is another game that means a lot to me because of how much there is you can do. You can build, farm, explore, and create anything you can imagine. You can choose to play the game exactly as it is, or dive into the many modpacks available online that completely change how you play the game. Mods can add new biomes, creatures, quest, technology, and many more that makes Minecraft more interactive.</span>

            <p class="game-title"><a href="https://godotengine.org" class="game-title" target="_blank">3. Astroneer</a></p>
            <span class="game-desc">Astroneer is a game I really enjoyed, and spent many hours exploring planetary systems. It is a very relaxing game about exploring planets, gathering resources, and building up yout base as you explore. The game is very layback and you could play at your own pace. There are many planets with their own ecosystems and resources, with large caves and mountains that make it satisfying to explore. It's a great game for anyone who likes exploration, space, or just another calm and lay-back adventure game.</span>

            <p class="game-title"><a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com" class="game-title" target="_blank">4. Kerbal Space Program</a></p>
            <span class="game-desc">Kerbal Space Program is a game I've always enjoyed becuase of how fun and suprisingly educational it is. You learn a lot in this game by just experimenting and watching your ships inevitably crash. There is a lot of physics in this game, all which you learn as you play. The progression allows you to pick up on things, such as re-entry heat panels and other rocket equipment that help your kerbal crew get back to Earth safely. There are many things you could do in this game, like launch satelites, to landing on different planets.</span>

            <p class="game-title"><a href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/" class="game-title" target="_blank">5. Hollow Knight</a></p>
            <span class="game-desc">Hollow Knight is a game that really stands out as one of my favorite platformers. The world of Hallownest has a lot to explore, with an amazing sountrack to keep you drawn. The game feels tough and definitely has a learning curve, that once passed you feel rewarded. There's many challanging bosses, each with their own attack moves, which you eventualy learn by repeatedly dying over and over until you are able to defeat it. It's a hard game, but that's what makes it so satisfying. I always recommend it tho anyone who enjoyes a real challenge.</span>
