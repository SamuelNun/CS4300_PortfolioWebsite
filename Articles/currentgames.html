        <p>I have played a lot of games throughout my life. From triple-A titles such as Legend of Zelda, to indie games like Hollow Knight, I have played a wide
            variety of games from a large amount of genres. In this article, I will list games I am playing as of this moment, and my current thought on them!

        <h2>UmaMusume: Pretty Derby!</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/31/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby_game_cover.jpg" alt="A group of characters with horse ears running">
        <p>The game I have been playing the most recently is UmaMusume! It is a game where you can raise students, called UmaMusume since they are horse girls, 
            to race against other horse girls. Throughout the course of the game, you get to learn more about the girls and learn about their aspirations. How 
            it is done is very compelling, because these horse girls are based on real horses that raced in Japan! It is a very fun game that has helped me learn 
            in a way I haven't thought of before!

        <h2>Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>

        <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong, also known as just Silksong, is a game made by a small team of 3 people, and was made as a follow up to the critically 
            acclaimed Hollow Knight. I am still in the middle of playing it, but have been enjoying it the whole way through. It is a soulslike game, which means 
            that combat is usually very difficult, and its not uncommon to get a game over when playing, but in fact expected. I would highly recommend if you 
            want a challenge and want to support indipendent creators!

        <h2>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</h2>
        <img src="https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/ar_16:9,c_lpad,w_1240/b_white/f_auto/q_auto/store/software/switch/70010000094234/357e68d5f1e168a213f3b2db2dda7da9e0ba2c0f0900360cc72c3f90649f7091">
        <p>The newest installment in the Pokemon series, this game has a lot of things taht make it different frm the mainline games. It uses a style of combat 
            completely unique to it game, where you can just attack without having to wait for another move to happen. The removal of this turn based combat makes 
            the game feel refreshing and unique. A fan, and personal, favorite mechanic, Mega Evolutions, also return, with a lot more evolutions available. Since 
            this is not a mainline series game, this style of gameplay will probably be restricted to just this game, but I am enjoying while I can!
