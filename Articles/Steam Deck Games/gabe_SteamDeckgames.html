<h1>Gabriel's Picks For Steam Deck</h1>
<h5>Written by: Gabriel Coronado</h5>

<div class="intro">
   <p>
      Handheld gaming has been more popular than ever and it's thanks in part to the Steam Deck created by Valve. Thanks to it's affordability and performance,
      steam's constantly expanding library and end user support; not only do users have a handheld option for pc gaming but they have a pc device in general as 
      the steam deck can be used dock and in a desktop mode similar to a windows machine. Truely one of the greatest options to get into pc gaming or to expand
      upon your capabilities. That being said, here are my top 5 picks to experience on the Steam Deck.
   </p>

   <div class="game-text">
      <h2>#1 — Metal Gear Solid Series</h2>
      <p>
         The Metal Gear Saga is one of the best fictional experiences ever and is a great way to experience how great the steam deck is. Especially in regards to
          the oled model, the soundtrack, the vocals and performance; all are highlighted in the oled model and was one of the best ways I ever experienced the MGS
          franchise.

   <div class="game-text">
      <h2>#2 — Deltarune</h2>
      <p>
        This game was such a ride, being as it is right now, it's a worth-while experience to be had on your steam deck, especially on the oled as the colors are just
        super vibrant and the speakers on the system really help lift the experience as the music isn't compromised. A must play game, geniunely.

   <div class="game-text">
      <h2>#3 — Baldur’s Gate 3</h2>
      <p>
         Baldur’s Gate 3 absorbed my life for weeks. The writing is incredible, and the freedom to shape your character’s story feels unmatched. Every choice matters 
         — sometimes in hilarious ways. No two playthroughs feel the same. Being able to bring it along with you is such a fantastic addition to your breaks or commute.
      </p>

<div class="game-section">
   <div class="game-text">
      <h2>#4 — Yakuza Collection</h2>
      <p>
         This series is amazing, it's chalked full of story and drama, some of the best characters you'll ever meet, and gameplay that is addicting. This had a grip on
         my everyday life for a good two years and being able to take it on the go was such a massive bonus. The games being mostly on last gen consoles make it super easy
         to run on the steam deck.

<div class="game-section">
   <div class="game-text">
      <h2>#5 — Persona 3 Reloaded</h2>
      <p>
         While my favorite will always be Persona 2 Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment, this is a great entry into the series that is geniunely a great experience to be had on the
         steam deck oled as the colors pop and the soundtrack sounds amazing with the quality sound drivers the steam deck possesses.
